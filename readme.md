## Introduction of Code Demo

**Firstly, we would like to thank the Program Committee members and the anonymous Reviewers for their great efforts in handling the review of our manuscript.**

There are nine files/folders in the source.

- data_factory: The preprocessing folder/file. All datasets preprocessing codes are here.
- dataset: The dataset folder, and you can download all datasets [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RaIJQ8esoWuhyphhmMaH-VCDh-WIluRR?usp=sharing).
- main.py: The main python file. You can adjustment  all parameters in there.
- metrics: There is the evaluation metrics code folder, which includes VUC, affiliation precision/recall pair, and other common metrics. The details can be corresponding to paper’s Section 4.2.
- model: DCdetector model folder. The details can be corresponding to paper’s Section 3.
- result: In our code demo, we can automatically save the results and train processing log in this folder.
- scripts: All datasets and ablation experiments scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results as get start shown.
- solver.py: Another python file. The training, validation, and testing processing are all in there. 
- utils: Other functions for data processing and model building.

## Get start
1. Install Python 3.6, PyTorch >= 1.4.0.
2. Download data. You can obtain all benchmarks from [Google Cloud](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RaIJQ8esoWuhyphhmMaH-VCDh-WIluRR?usp=sharing). All the datasets are well pre-processed.
3. Train and evaluate. We provide the experiment scripts of all benchmarks under the folder ./scripts. You can reproduce the experiment results as follows:

```bash
bash ./scripts/SMD.sh
bash ./scripts/MSL.sh
bash ./scripts/SMAP.sh
bash ./scripts/PSM.sh
bash ./scripts/NIPS_TS_Swan.sh
bash ./scripts/NIPS_TS_Water.sh
bash ./scripts/UCR.sh
bash ./scripts/UCR.AUG.sh
```

Also, some scripts of ablation experiments.

```bash
bash ./scripts/Ablation_attention_head.sh
bash ./scripts/Ablation_encoder_layer.sh
bash ./scripts/Ablation_Multiscale.sh
bash ./scripts/Ablation_Window_Size.sh
```
